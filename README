Hey. This is a gradual attempt to turn Georgia's CSV sex offender
registry into an automagically updated Google Fusion Tables map. It's a work
in progress, to be sure. A to-do list appears in the main file, scrape.py,
and may even be sort of kind of up-to-date.

scrape.py also includes descriptions of what the fields are and where they
come from. It also includes sample code for Fusion Tables.

Use easy_install to fetch geopy. Everything else should come stock with
Python 2.7.

Scream if you need me. Collaborators welcome, though I have no earthly
idea who else would have an interest in this.
