Hey. This is a gradual attempt to turn Georgia's CSV sex offender
registry into an automagically updated Google Fusion Table map. It's a work
in progress, to be sure. The to-do list may or may not be included in the main
file, scrape.py.

Use easy_install to fetch geopy. Everything else should come stock with
Python 2.7.

Scream if you need me. Collaborators welcome, though I have no earthly
idea who else would have an interest in this.
